# JS-File-Server
A Node.js system implementing a note-taking webpage that saves the user's notes via a backend file server.

To run the file server, either:

1. Decompress and run the executable

2. Enter "npm install" and "node server.js" in terminal.

Note: For the 2nd option, change the base directory to "process.cwd()" so the program uses the current working directory to access notes.txt.
